        "Eccentric millionaire John Hammond has invited three dinosaur experts see his new amusement park before it opens. The park is on an island off Costa Rica and is populated by actual, living dinosaurs that Hammond has created using DNA harvested from pre-historic insects. The scientists are joined by Hammond's two grandchildren during their preview of the park and the group is enjoying the tour in their computer-controlled cars until a storm knocks out power on the island.
